### Short Description for Spam and Ham Email Classifier

A spam and ham email classifier is a machine learning model designed to distinguish between spam (unwanted or unsolicited emails) and ham (legitimate or desired emails). This type of classifier uses features extracted from the content and metadata of emails to make predictions about their nature. 

The typical process involves:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a dataset of emails labeled as spam or ham.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Converting the email content into numerical features that can be used by the model. Common techniques include text vectorization methods like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
3. **Model Training**: Using a machine learning algorithm, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or a neural network, to learn patterns that differentiate spam from ham based on the extracted features.
4. **Prediction**: Applying the trained model to new, unseen emails to classify them as spam or ham.
5. **Evaluation**: Measuring the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure it accurately identifies spam and ham emails.

The classifier can be integrated into email systems to automatically filter out spam, improving the user's email experience by reducing the number of unwanted messages in their inbox.
